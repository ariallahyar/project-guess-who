# Guess Who Game

The assignment was to create a digital version of the classic board game "Guess Who" to:
- Practice using objects and arrays
- Gain knowledge about closures and scope
- Structure code in functions
- Manipulate the DOM

Expected game behaviour:
- A character is randomly selected and set to the secret at the start of the game
- A player can select questions to filter the board based on those questions
- A player receives feedback in the form of alerts
- A player can guess the secret person and receive confirmation on whether or not they were correct

Stretch goals reached:
- Counter to track how may guesses a player makes
- Limit on the number of questions before forcing a player to make a guess
